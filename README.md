# PAC.js

PAC.js is a JavaScript framework that is based on the PAC architecture pattern.

Although a lot of JavaScript MVC frameworks are in now, PAC.js provides more manageable,
secure and solid structure to today's rich web applications.

Due to its philosophy, PAC.js is far more suitable for the system integration industry.
