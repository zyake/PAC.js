simple-pac
==========

simple-pac is a framework that is based on the PAC architecture pattern.

In traditional MVC frameworks, there are no abstraction of widgets and hierarchal structures.
On other hand, the PAC pattern resolves these problems more gracefully,
so I decided to develop a PAC based framework.

The key concepts of the simple-pac are following.
* PAC pattern based hierarchal structure
* Very simple, template based transition mechanism
* DI container like component management facility
* Proxying application abstractions that reside on application servers
